# Flutter Todo App

A clean and production‑ready **Flutter Todo Application** built using **Clean Architecture + Riverpod + MVVM patterns**.

This project demonstrates professional Flutter engineering practices expected in a modern mobile team: scalable architecture, reactive state management, dependency injection, modular folder structure, reusable components, and maintainable code.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Add, Edit, Delete todos
✅ Persist data locally
✅ Riverpod state management
✅ Clean Architecture + MVVM
✅ Repository pattern
✅ Custom UI widgets
✅ Error + empty + loading states
✅ Dart Lints & best practices

## 🎯 Why This Project?

This app is designed to align with expectations for **Flutter interviews and real‑world team environments**.

It highlights skills such as:

* Writing clean & scalable code
* Proper folder structure and architecture
* Understanding state management (Riverpod)
* Reusable widgets & themes
* API / data layer separation (mocked for demo)
* Meaningful git history and commit messages
